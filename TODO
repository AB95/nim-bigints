- Can't multiply number with itself x *= x, probably also same for other operations
- Should probably use ref object instead of tuple for BigInt type
- Fix the library on 32bit
- Fix the templates so they work with uninitialized (nil) values!
- karatsuba multiplication
- better addition
- everything in combination with normal ints and uints too
(- better division)
- test suite
